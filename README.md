## Hi I'm Louis 👋

I'm a dev currently working at Sky UK.
This GitHub account is my dedicated space for personal projects, learning and experimentation - a fresh workspace seperate from my enterprise work.

Here you'll find:
- Small projects and exercises from my ongoing learning.
- Experiments and practice repos.
- A growing set of more polished standalone projects.

My aim is to keep a continuous record while deepening my understanding of software engineering.

Thanks for stopping by!
